# Project Organization Summary

## ✅ Files Organized Successfully

### Moved to `scripts/`:
- `capture_emulator.py` - Screen capture utility

### Moved to `scripts/dashboards/`:
- `local_dashboard.py` - macOS optimized dashboard
- `cloud_dashboard.py` - Headless cloud dashboard  
- `enhanced_dashboard.py` - Full-featured dashboard

### Moved to `scripts/tests/`:
- `quick_emulator_test.py` - Quick emulator test
- `test_bot_control.py` - Bot control test
- `test_cloud_emulator.sh` - Cloud emulator test
- `test_setup.py` - Environment setup test

### Moved to `docs/`:
- `CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Cloud architecture documentation
- `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` - Deployment status and progress
- `FIRST_TEST_SUMMARY.md` - Initial testing results
- `GCP_DEPLOYMENT_READY.md` - GCP deployment readiness
- `GCP_INSTANCE_CONFIG.md` - GCP instance configuration
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - This project structure document

### Removed Duplicates:
- Removed duplicate `simple_dashboard.py` from root (kept in scripts/)
- Removed duplicate `deploy-gcp.sh` from root (kept in scripts/)
- Removed build artifact `pokemon-rl-bot.tar.gz`

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
2. **Environment Specific**: Separate dashboards for local vs cloud
3. **Easy Navigation**: Logical grouping in subdirectories
4. **No Duplicates**: Eliminated redundant files
5. **Proper Documentation**: All docs in dedicated folder

## 🚀 Next Steps

Now that the project is properly organized, we can:

1. Test the local dashboard: `python scripts/dashboards/local_dashboard.py`
2. Deploy to cloud: `./scripts/deploy-gcp.sh deploy`
3. Run specific tests: `python scripts/tests/test_setup.py`

The project is now much cleaner and more maintainable!
